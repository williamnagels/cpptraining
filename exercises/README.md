# C++ training exercises

To get going with these exercises you could:
1. Compile the test binaries (using the CMakeLists.txt in the current folder):
```
mkdir build
cmake . build/
make build
ls build/bin
```
2. Navigate to the folder of the module you're interested in (e.g., containers). Open the corresponding exercise file, such as ex1.cpp, to start with the first exercise.
3. Look for the symbol test_1 within the file and read the associated documentation. The instructions should clarify what needs to be done. Each test file will typically contain several local symbols like test_1, test_2, etc., and one global symbol, such as cont_ex1. This global symbol is called by the test binary.
