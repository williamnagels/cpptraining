# Compiler test
## Building
This CMake project includes a binary to verify if your environment is capable of compiling all exercises. The key requirements are your compiler's support for C++20 features and CMake.

- For GCC, you need at least version 10.1.
- For Clang, the minimum supported version is 11.
- CMake version 3.0

If your current setup doesn't meet these requirements, or if you're using an older version of CMake/Clang/GCC and don't want to modify your system, thereâ€™s an Alpine-based Docker container provided
that includes the correct GCC version. The container is also a handy solution if you're using Windows or need a clean, isolated environment for building.
If you use the container, its best to volume mount the compilertest sources using the -v start-up parameter.
The example below assumes that <PATH_TO_COMPILERTEST_FOLER> is replaced with an actual path on your system. It should be replaced with the path to the folder where this README.md file is located in.
- Build the container
```
docker build -t cpptraining <PATH_TO_COMPILERTEST_FOLER>
```
- Build and run the test binary in the container
```
docker run --rm -v <PATH_TO_COMPILERTEST_FOLER>:/source cpptraining /bin/sh -c 'cmake -B /build -S /source ; cmake --build /build; /build/compilerTest'
```
If you are not using a container you can build using the commands from the second code snippet, ofcourse the paths /build /source may have to be updated.
## Expected result
Expected output when running the compilerTest binary:
```
Coroutine check OK
Concept check OK
```
There should be NO compiler errors.
