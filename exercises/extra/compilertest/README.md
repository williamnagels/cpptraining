This CMake project includes tools to verify if your environment is capable of compiling all exercises. The key requirement is your compiler's support for C++20 features.

- For GCC, you need at least version 10.1.
- For Clang, the minimum supported version is 11.

If your current setup doesn't meet these requirements, or if you're using an older version of Clang/GCC and don't want to modify your system, thereâ€™s an Alpine-based Docker container provided
that includes the correct GCC version. This is also a handy solution if you're using Windows or need a clean, isolated environment for building.
If you use the container, its best to volume mount the compilertest sources using -v start-up parameter.
The example below assumes that <PATH_TO_COMPILERTEST_FOLER> is replaced with an actual path on your system. It should be replaced with the path to the folder where this README.md file is located in.
Build the container
'''
docker build -t cpptraining <PATH_TO_COMPILERTEST_FOLER>
'''
Build and run the test binary
'''
docker run --rm -v <PATH_TO_COMPILERTEST_FOLER>:/source cpptraining /bin/sh -c 'cmake -B /build -S /source ; cmake --build /build; /build/compilerTest'
'''
